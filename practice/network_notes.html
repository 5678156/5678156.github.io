		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<ol>

			<li><strong>Which Direction</strong><li>
		
					<ul>
						<li>The computer doesn't know 
							where it's supposed to
							send the message to, so
							it send it to a random
							place</li>
					</ul>
			<li><strong>Lost</strong></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the messages get
							lost or corrupted on
							the way of sending it
						</li>
					</ul>
			<li><strong>Out of Order</strong></li>
		
					<ul>
						<li>The messages that the
							computer sends mightbe
							recieved out of order
						</li>
					</ul>
		</ol>
		<h2>Protocols</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Highly connected</strong></li>
		
					<ul>
						<li>This helped us too see the
							path required to send 
							the message</li>
					</ul>
		
			<li><strong>Summary of that message</strong></li>
		
					<ul>
						<li>This helps the message to
							be in a more condensed
							format</li>
					</ul>
		</ol>
