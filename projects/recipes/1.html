		<h3>Tips, Tricks, and Substiutions</h3>
		<h4>Tips</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Use canned pumpkin puree - </strong>This
				will add a rich pumpkin taste and perfectly 
				moist texture</li>
			<li><strong>Let the spices shine - </strong>This
				pumpkin	bread has spices that makes it so it's                                  
				 not too sweet, but enough to give off an
				 amazing flavor</li>
			<li><strong>Make it special when you serve it - 
				</strong>Serve it with a little extra, maybe 
				chocolate chips.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Tricks</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When you gently press the top center of the bread
				with your fingers, it should spring back.</li>
			<li>Insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf. It
				should come out clean with maybe a few crumbs,
				but not wet batter</li>
			<li>You'll know when the bread is done if it is warm,
				golden brown, and some small cracks</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Substitutions</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Conola oil can be used instead of vegetable oil
			</li>
			<li>Ginger can be used instead of nutmeg. Only using
				half the amount of nutmeg the recipe calls for
			</li>
			<li>Pumpkin pie spice can be used instead of cinnamon
			</li>
		</ul>
