	<div class="menu"><ul><li>Once you have mixed the dough, the sourdough starter
		will start to ferment the dough, which will give it its nice
		rise and airy feel.</li> <li>There are 2 phases to Fermenting.</li><ol><li>The first 
			phase is called Bulk Fermentation.</li><ul><li> 
During Bulk Fermentation, the dough will become less sticky and more cohesive.
It will be easier to handle.</li><li> For the first 2 hours, you must perform a series
of "stretch and folds" every 30 minutes.</li><li> See photos but you simply lift a side
of the dough and fold it over the top.</li><li> Turn the bowl 90 degrees and do another 
stretch and fold.</li><li> Do it a total of 4 times.</li><li> Then cover and let sit for 30 more
minutes.</li><li> You will do stretch and folds 4 times during the first 2 hours.</li><li> Then
you let the dough continue to bulk ferment on the counter for another 2-3 hours
until it has doubled in size and looks airy.</li></ul> 
		<li>During the Cold Proofing, you dump the dough out of the mixing bowl and do a 
			series of folds and then flip the dough over so the seam side is down.</li><ul><li>  Use
your fingers to turn and pull the dough so the seam side down becomes tighter 
and the top is "jiggly" and smooth.</li><li> 

Now turn the dough upside down into a floured basket.</li><li> The seams will now be on
top and the smooth side in the bottom of the floured basket.</li><li> Cover and put 
into the fridge for 6-12 hours or overnight.</li><li> The dough will continue to ferment
slowly in the fridge in the shape you made and expand a bit  into the shape of
the basket.</li><li> Basket can be round or oval.</li></ul></ol></ul></div>
